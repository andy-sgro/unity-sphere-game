* NAME	  : Physics
* PURPOSE : 
*	- This static class gives vector/trig math functions to all classes.
*	- This is modeled after the Math class in many libraries.
*	- The domain of this class:
*		- Trig angle/distance vector math.
*		- Pool table physics (Newton's 'energy transfer' mechanics aren't covered yet:()
*		- Orbital mechanics (Einstien's 'general relativity' is not covered)
*	- This is used by any class that wants to do easy trig/physics math.
*	- It is recommended that you create non-static classes that abstract these methods.
